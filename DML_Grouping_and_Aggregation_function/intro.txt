Aggregate Functions & GROUP BY

    - Working with GROUP BY & HAVING vs WHERE

    AGGREGATE FUNCTION

        - Aggregate
            Mathematical operation returning a single (aggregated) result.
        - Function 
            Predefined operation, which can be executed on demund

        Example OF CORE AGGREGATED FUNCTIONS:
            COUNT(), SUM(), MAX(), MIN(), AVG() 

            UNDERSTANDING:

                - COUNT() Aggregate the number of items    
                - MIN() and MAX() Find Minimum or maximum value
                - SUM() Aggregate summing of items 
                - AVG() Finds average for items (REM => AVERAGE ignore NULL values)
                - ROUND() Round result(if we do not provide second argument it rounds to integer)

            GROUP BY is cool =-)

                Groop items with similar values by columns...

                    WHERE vs HAVING

                        WHERE and HAVING are two kinds of filtering statements

                            WHERE for regular select

                            HAVING for grouped(aggregated) data

ORDER OF EXECUTION IN SQL:

    IN SQL THERE IS ORDER OF EXECUTION!

    FROM and/or JOIN clause => WHERE clause => GROUP BY clause => HAVING clause => SELECT clause => DISTINCT clause => ORDER BY clause => LIMIT and/or OFFSET clause.
