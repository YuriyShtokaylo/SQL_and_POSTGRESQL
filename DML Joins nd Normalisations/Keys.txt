    PRIMARY KEYS

        ! Primary keys don't have to be auto-incrementing integers !
        PRIMARY KEY should be UNIQUE and NOT NULL
        Just ONE PRIMARY KEY per TABLE

    COMPOSITE PRIMARY KEYS

        You must only have one primary key per table 
                        but
        Primary keys can span multiple columns     

        SURROGATE KEY - it acts as a unique primary identifier but isn't the real unique identification criteria 

            THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH USING SURROGATE KEYS

        EXAMPLE: PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2) <= THIS MEAN THAT OUR PRIMARY KEY IS UNIQ COMBINATION OF VALUES IN TWO DIFFERENT COLUMNS.
